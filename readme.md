# Grubdash

A hypothetical dining service which serves a single restaurant's needs. Using CRUD principles the owner could create, read, update and delete dishes from the server. Then anyone could create, read and (conditionally) update new orders. The data comes back using jsonapi specifications. 

 Front end sold separately.
